Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated interact or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others including when the particles are separated by a large distance The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics Measurements of physical properties such as position momentum spin and polarization performed on entangled particles can in some cases be found to be perfectly correlated For example if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis then the spin of the other particle measured on the same axis will be found to be counterclockwise However this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects any measurement of a property of a particle results in an irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and will change the original quantum state In the case of entangled particles such a measurement will affect the entangled system as a whole Such phenomena were the subject of a paper by Albert Einstein Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen and several papers by shortly thereafter describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox Einstein and others considered such behavior to be impossible as it violated the local realism view of causality Einstein referring to it as spooky action at a distance and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete Later however the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified experimentally in tests in which polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations statistically violating Bells inequality In earlier tests it couldn be absolutely ruled out that the test result at one point could have been subtly transmitted to the remote point affecting the outcome at the second location However so called loophole free Bell tests have been performed in which the locations were separated such that communications at the speed of light would have taken longer in one case times longer than the interval between the measurements According to some interpretations of quantum mechanics the effect of one measurement occurs instantly Other interpretations which do not recognize wavefunction collapse dispute that there is any effect at all However all interpretations agree that entanglement produces correlation between the measurements and that the mutual information between the entangled particles can be exploited but that any transmission of information at faster than light speeds is impossible
